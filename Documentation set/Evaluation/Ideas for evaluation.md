- Webscraping songs and getting audio features easier than expected. 
- 
- idea: MST : not ideal, because shows only information of connected songs, distance between unconnected songs is arbitrary -->
    better visualization is reached by PCA and visualizing the data in 3D. The clusters can be found together, but it can be seen the songs do not really show distinct groups 
    
- clustering: actually not the best method, since there are no distinct groups (see silhouette etc)


- audio features: hard to capture all experience of a song by just features. give example christmas songs --> computer cannot replicate this kind of recognition 
--> for this spotify applies machine learning on user information
- for human also really hard to cluster and to validate based on these features! Easier to classify based on theme: christmas, party song, sad love song etc. than on beat, energy 

- future idea: use many players playlists and place songs often occurring in same playlist together?


- could haves: did not do user select 2 songs bc not so relevant, user input not compatible with k means
