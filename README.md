# Welcome to SPOTICHART 

This project is part of the Computer Science Project of the TU Delft Computer Science Minor.

The aim of our project is to cluster songs in [the spotify top200 chart](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) based on similarity.
To this extent, we use audio features made accessible by spotify, such as danceability, acousticness and energy.
We use the KMeans algorithm to cluster the songs and visualize it in 3D by applying PCA.
Our main goal is to find out whether it is possible to evaluate songs based only on audio features or whether music is too subjective to be evaluated this way.
Our conclusions can be found in our evaluation.


To find out more about our goals, strategies, results or to see a demo video please take a look at our:

Our code can be found in the [Project folder](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/ewi3615tu/2019-2020/data/ewi3615tu-ds10/ewi3615tu-ds10/tree/master/Project). 
To run our program, run the "Main.py" file. To view and listen to the songs, that the program outputs, you will have to be logged in on Spotify.
